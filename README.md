In this project, building a **Match Game** by applying the concepts we have learned till now in React development. We'll utilize state management to keep track of the game's progress, including which cards are flipped and matched. By breaking down the user interface into reusable components such as `ImgItem`, `TabItem`, we'll ensure a structured and maintainable codebase. Event handling will play a crucial role as we implement functionality to flip cards upon clicking and check for matches. Additionally, we'll employ conditional rendering to dynamically display the cards' faces or backs based on their current state. Finally, we'll enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the game by applying CSS styling techniques. Through these concepts, we'll create an engaging and interactive Match Game experience for players to enjoy.

<summary>Functionality to be added</summary>
<br/>

The app must have the following functionalities

- Initially,
  - Score should be `0` and time should be `60` sec
  - The image to be matched should have the src attribute value as the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
  - The **Fruits** tab should be active and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- The timer should start running backwards from the `60` sec
- When a tab is clicked, then the thumbnails in the corresponding category should be displayed
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if that is matched with the image to be matched,
  - Score is incremented by one
  - The new image to be matched should be generated randomly among the value of the key `imageUrl` from **imagesList** provided
- When a thumbnail is clicked, if it is not matched with the image to be matched,
  - The game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
  - When **PLAY AGAIN** button is clicked, then we should be able to play the game again
    - The score and time values should be reset to `0` and `60` sec respectively
    - The image to be matched should reset to the value of the key `imageUrl` from the first object in **imagesList** provided
    - The active tab should reset to **Fruits**, and the thumbnails with **FRUIT** as their category should be displayed
- When the timer reached `0` sec, then the game should end, and the [Scorecard](https://assets.ccbp.in/frontend/content/react-js/match-game-score-card-lg-output.png) view should be displayed
- The App is provided with `tabsList`. It consists of a list of tabItem objects with the following properties in each tabItem object

  |     Key     | Data Type |
  | :---------: | :-------: |
  |    tabId    |  String   |
  | displayText |  String   |

- The App is provided with `imagesList`. It consists of a list of imageItem objects with the following properties in each imageItem object

  |     Key      | Data Type |
  | :----------: | :-------: |
  |      id      |  String   |
  |   imageUrl   |  String   |
